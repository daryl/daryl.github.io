  You just had to look, didn't you. You just knew there had to be more to this.

  Fine, here's your cat riding a unicorn https://i.pinimg.com/originals/59/ec/c7/59ecc7511574e89c733f357fc1fed9d1.jpg

    <p>This is my website</p>
    <p>Yep, this is it.</p>
    <p>Why can’t things be this simple?</p>
    <p>Why does everything need wild gradients and animation?</p>
    <p>Would it impress you more if a cat riding a unicorn whilst shooting rainbows from a laser gun came running in from the side of the screen?</p>
    <p>Probably, but I don’t have time for that.</p>
    <p>I bet you thought that might actually happen now I said it.</p>
    <p>But, honestly, this is as good as it gets.</p>
    <p>Plus this is the first time I’ve updated it in 2 years.</p>
    <p>So, sorry to disappoint you.</p>
    <p>You’re still reading thinking something might happen, aren’t you?</p>
    <p>I honestly can’t believe you’ve made it this far, why are you wasting your time like this?</p>
    <p>I promise you this is it.</p>
    <p>Oh, I almost forgot, every portfolio should at least have a way to email, so I guess I’ll include that.</p>
    <p>Here, if you need to <a href="mailto:itsdginn@icloud.com">email me</a>.</p>
    <p>That’s all for now.</p>
    <p>You can stop reading.</p>
    <p>Honestly.</p>
    <p>There’s no big finish.</p>
    <p>See you next time.</p>
    <p>Daryl</p>
