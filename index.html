    <p>Welcome to my website</p>
    <p>Yep, this is it.</p>
    <p>Is this allowed?</p>
    <p>Can we just... chat?</p>
    <p>Why can’t things be this simple?</p>
    <p>Why does everything need wild gradients and animation?</p>
    <p>Would it impress you more if a cat riding a unicorn that breathes fire came running in from the side of the screen?</p>
    <p>Probably, but I don’t have time for that.</p>
    <p>I bet you thought that might actually happen now I've said it.</p>
    <p>But honestly, this is as good as it gets.</p>
    <p>Plus this is the first time I’ve updated this site in 2 years, so you can probably tell I don't care about it <i>that</i> much.</p>
    <p>I mean look at it, it's literally a wall of text. Who is actually going to read all his?</p>
    <p>Certainly not you, right?</p>
    <p>If you're anything like me you'll probably close this off right now.</p>
    <p>But for some reason you're still reading thinking something might happen, aren't you?</p>
    <p>I honestly can’t believe you’ve made it this far, surely you have better things to do?</p>
    <p>Your boss is probably wondering why you haven't responded to their Slack message about yet another <i>urgent</i> call you need to hop on.</p>
    <p>And I can't be responsible if you get fired.</p>
    <p>I promise you, this is it.</p>
    <p>There's no big finalé to get excited about.</p>
    <p>Oh, I almost forgot, every website should at least have a way to send an email, so I guess I’ll include that.</p>
    <p>Here, if you need to, <a href="mailto:itsdginn@icloud.com">email me</a>.</p>
    <p>That’s all for now.</p>
    <p>You can stop reading.</p>
    <p>Honestly, I really don't want to waste your time any more than I already have.</p>
    <p>I get it, you think I'm bluffing, there <i>has</i> to be something more.</p>
    <p>Surely I wouldn't do all this text for no reason.</p>
    <p>A simple site, that's all I wanted.<p>
    <p>Nothing more. Nothing less.</p>
    <p>Now you've made it awkward for me, because you've come all this way, yet I've given you nothing.</p>
    <p>You're feeling unsatisfied.</p>
    <p>Where's this mysterious unicorn? Why do I even care? That's all you want to know at this point.</p>
    <p>Fine, <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/59/ec/c7/59ecc7511574e89c733f357fc1fed9d1.jpg">here's your unicorn</a>.</p>
    <p>It's not even that impressive really, is it?</p>
    <p>What a waste of our time that was.</p>
    <p>Now, can we end this nonsense once and for all?</p>
    <p>Great, thanks!</p>
    <p>See you next time.</p>
    <p>Daryl</p>
